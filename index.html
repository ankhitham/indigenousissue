      <p >
        <strong class="GlowColor">To commemorate</strong> this Indigenous Peoples Day, The Daily Princetonian has worked to amplify the
        voices and
        experiences of Indigenous peoples on our campus. This project could not possibly exhaust the stories of
        Native peoples at Princeton, nor does it aim to. Instead it marks a re-commitment by the ‘Prince’ to welcome
        Native and Indigenous Princetonians into our paper, on their own terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The opening words of this project are written in Osage; Graduate student Rodrigo Córdova Rosado’s essay is
        grounded in a Native language that is undergoing revival. This project features profiles of Gustavo
        Blanco-Quiroga ’25 and Jessica Lambert ’22, two Indigenous students who have worked to innovatively use
        University resources to serve their own Native communities. And in a special podcast, the ‘Prince’ highlights
        the history of Dr. Alfonso Ortiz, an anthropologist at Princeton in the 1970s whose study of his own community
        — the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo — and staunch advocacy for Indigenous scholarship continues to have effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through powerful opinion essays that grapple with the legacy of Princeton-affiliated Sheldon Jackson and
        exploitative tourism to Hawai’i, a photo essay featuring perspectives of members of Natives at Princeton, and
        interviews with Native scholars, artists, activists, and community leaders, we hope to spark conversations
        that go far beyond the confines of this brief web project.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope that this effort may be one of many: Each story we are honored to feature here may lay the groundwork
        for another yet to be told.

        <b class="PowerColor">𐓰𐓘𐓲𐓘 𐓵𐓘𐓻𐓪𐓲𐓟</b>​​​​, I hear the crashing ocean in the rustling of leaves along
        the limbs of the ginkgo
        north of Prospect House. I hear finches chirp as the morning dew moistens my shoes as I pass Lewis Library. And
        I remember the humidity of my island and the smell of petrichor as the rain pelts my window in Forbes.&nbsp;

        Land and memory are a reflective combination. They have defined the Native experience on this land — now known
        as the United States — long before Jefferson inked his quill. The land we stand on was stolen from the Lenape —
        the memories ripped from it like a sapling from its roots — for us to live with the consequences. To live in
        Princeton as a member of an Indian Nation, Tribe, or “domestic dependent nation,” as the U.S. Bureau of Indian
        Affairs defines federally-recognized Native communities, is to be keenly aware of this history and the
        responsibility of the present to address the consequences of the past. It is to be aware of the exposed roots
        rotting for lack of care on the land and in our memory.

        <b class="PowerColor">I am a guest on this land.</b> I come from people who lived on Borinquén (now known as
        Puerto Rico) before the
        historical record begins, from people who built cities along the Middle Waters (the Mississippi River Valley),
        from people who were uprooted to Indian territory in Oklahoma, and from people who sailed the Atlantic in search
        of spices but arrived to find conquest.<b class="PowerColor">I am 𐓷𐓘𐓻𐓘𐓻𐓟, Osage, and have arrived on this
          land made of soil
          foreign to me.</b> In sharing this feeling with all of our communities, we must ask: How do we grow in this
        unfamiliar place? How do we tend the roots ripped from the earth in the place we seek to grow our own?
      </p>
      <p>
        Being a part of the Indigenous community here is one of the highlights of my time at Princeton. Whether we’re
        discussing water rights in the Southwest, or the push and pull in our communities over the sacred and how it
        impacts people and projects like mountaintop telescopes, or feeling like your identity is reflected by folks in
        a new and strange place: communities have the power to build new homes. They are the mycelial network that ties
        us together. This is the ongoing project of revitalization: a reaction to the centuries of physical and cultural
        genocide that took place here. From Indigenous language courses to the engendering of Indigenous studies in
        academia, <b class="PowerColor">we are attempting to re-seed what boarding schools, forced assimilation, land
          allotments, and the
          destruction of our environments took away from us.</b> And yet, we still do not have an Indigenous studies
        program
        at Princeton, a dedicated space for Native peoples, nor do we discuss what the purpose of a land acknowledgment
        truly is. Like many things in Native communities, perhaps these will come with time. Unfortunately, time is
        running out.

        I was a junior in college when Hurricane María blew through my home. The last thing my dad told me before I lost
        contact with my family for a week was “no te preocupes (not to worry), la casa está hecha de ladrillos, no de
        ramas o paja (the house is made of bricks, not sticks or straw.)” Last week we had the same conversation. Last
        week my family in Florida, land of the Seminole, Calusa, and Myaamia, was struck by such a hurricane as María.
        Last year the forests around the world burned. This year our forests have burned. <b class="GlowColor">Will
          there even be a forest
          next year?</b>

        Accelerating climate change poses an existential threat to land and memory, the core of who we are. Rising to
        the challenges we have been given means starting with recognition of our responsibility to the land, and each
        other. We who were born of stars that exploded billions of years ago, given form on the Earth made from that
        stardust: we are made of this land, and we must relearn how to live on it. <a
          href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/publication/PB_101.pdf">Eighty
          percent of the world’s biodiversity</a> is cared for by Indigenous communities, contained within 20 percent of
        the land, held by five percent of humanity. We have <a
          href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1609775113">grown with the land</a> as it grew with us, and
        it is time to return the land to its caretakers. Not only because it was wantonly and savagely stolen — just
        read how Andrew Jackson’s soldiers made <a
          href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DTeDDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=skin#v=snippet&amp;q=long%20strips%20of%20skin&amp;f=false">horse
          bridle reins from Native skin</a> — but because our track record of caring for the land is a few millennia
        long. As a recent anthropology <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/sciadv.abn2927"
          target="_self">paper</a> put it, Indigenous Peoples hold essential knowledge for the conservation of our
        planet’s biodiversity, so partnership, rather than endless cycles of ecological impact studies, just might avert
        the ecological collapse ahead of us. In the rapidly changing landscape of the future, I see a need to
        interrogate what we intend to do to seek justice alongside survival.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        To walk on this campus is to know there is the potential for amazing, transformative action. It is also to know
        these walkways cover the land and the blood spilled on it. To hold both of these truths is the responsibility of
        our communities. To see land and memory intertwined, the physical world and our experience of it, is perhaps one
        of the greatest lessons my communities have taught me. It guides my path in wanting to research the cosmic past
        and our human perception of it, and it reminds me how unlikely I was to be the one to ask these questions.

        On rainy days I remember afternoons at my grandparents’ watching “Plaza Sésamo” — Big Bird’s role is played by a
        colorful parrot named Abelardo. The campus leaves are turning the color of the warm sunset I watched over the
        ocean after eating some of the day’s catch with a side of coconut arepas from Don Candi in Fajardo, Puerto Rico.
        On cloudless nights we observe planets at the Peyton Hall telescope, almost like the moments back home, after I
        sat on a beach and saw the Milky Way for the first time. The water was cool and the rising Moon was yellow.

      <h1 class="headline">‘That’s why I’m here at Princeton’: Gustavo Blanco-Quiroga ’25 serves home community in
        Bolivia through Pace Center grant</h1>
      <p class="yellow">By Sydney Eck</p>
      <p>
        For Gustavo Blanco-Quiroga ’25, a Princeton education presents first and foremost an opportunity: “I wanted to
        redirect the privilege and education I have to my community.”&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        The John H. Pace Jr. ’39 Center for Civil Engagement’s Projects for Peace program <a
          href="https://pace.princeton.edu/get-involved/pace-center-programs/projects-peace" target="_self">awards
          $10,000</a> to University undergraduates to “implement an innovative service project anywhere in the world —
        or right in their own backyard.” The award, for Blanco-Quiroga, became another key chance to give back to his
        Indigenous community back home in Bolivia.

      </p>
      <p>
        “I am from the Aymara Indigenous community, which is one of 36 communities we have in Bolivia. It’s a beautiful
        community where we practice reciprocity and service,” he said in an interview with The Daily Princetonian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeking to emulate that tradition of “reciprocity and service” this past summer, Blanco-Quiroga used the
        Projects for Peace funding to start the <a href="https://pace.princeton.edu/news/2022/projects-peace-22"
          target="_blank">Chacha Emprende Project</a>, a two-pronged approach to bringing education and resources back
        to his community.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “The project is based on workshops for gender equality and supporting entrepreneurship for Indigenous leaders,”
        Blanco-Quiroga explained.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Stephanie Guarachi, a Bolivian youth mentor and a friend of Blanco-Quiroga’s, helped develop the original
        concept for the project.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “We were really looking at these big issues and how the project could help,” she told the ‘Prince.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The Chacha Emprende Project addressed the issue of violence against women in Bolivia by hosting “new
        masculinity” workshops for male Indigenous community leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We wanted to create a project that not only attacked the problem of gender inequity but addressed the ones who
        produce it, which is often men,” Blanco-Quiroga said.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The participants are all leaders within their Indigenous communities,” he explained. “I think after having been
        in these workshops they have already started changing their behaviors. And they will inspire others.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Pace Center Assistant Director for Engaged Pedagogy Matt Lynn worked with Blanco-Quiroga to support him as he
        organized and executed the project. When discussing Blanco-Quiroga’s project, Lynn told the ‘Prince’ that “some
        of the most pressing issues that I think Indigenous communities in Bolivia face are those social forces that
        Gustavo’s project really dug into, such as violence that is rooted in colonial structures of gender.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Working with young men specifically is quite revolutionary for Bolivia,” said Lynn, who previously lived in
        Bolivia for 15 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second part of the Chacha Emprende Project focused on developing and financing entrepreneurship projects for
        Indigenous leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Communities in Latin America have been hit very hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and Bolivia is trying to recover
        [its] economy,” Blanco-Quiroga said. “That’s why we have that entrepreneurship piece.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I am so proud of everything they did,” Guarachi said when discussing the entrepreneurship initiatives that were
        developed and ultimately funded through the Chacha Emprende Project.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It was a challenge to pick which projects would receive funding,” Blanco-Quiroga said. “We got so many really
        amazing proposals.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The projects that were selected by Blanco-Quiroga and a team of judges all aim to serve Indigenous communities
        in Bolivia. One initiative is dedicated to providing marketing services in Indigenous languages in addition to
        Spanish. Another initiative works with Indigenous artisans to advertise and sell their products at a fair price
        in cities.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “Gustavo did a really good job identifying a community need in his own context, in his own community,” Lynn
        said. “I don’t think there was anything major that he didn’t contemplate before going down there because he knew
        the context so well. He knew the needs so well.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Guarachi agreed: “Gustavo was the right person to plan this project for his community.”&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        To Guarachi, Blanco-Quiroga’s dedication to his home community felt particularly impressive because of her own
        experience with many young Bolivians who feel separated from their history and culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’m part of the second or third generation to live in the city. Sometimes I feel like I am Bolivian by
        nationality but not by culture,” she said. “I think something a lot of people feel about their history and their
        ancestors is this idea of ‘you are not entirely, but you are still.’ Gustavo brought that experience of being in
        the Indigenous community.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “This project, though it was a lot of work, has filled me with energy,” Blanco-Quiroga said. “Seeing how there
        are so many talented young people in Bolivia has inspired me to keep working to help them after I graduate from
        Princeton.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Blanco-Quiroga discussed how communities at Princeton have further shaped his views on Indigenous rights issues
        and supported him in his advocacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        “A big part of my freshman experience was with <a
          href="https://indigenous.princeton.edu/community/natives-princeton">Natives at Princeton</a>. I think it is
        such a beautiful community that I am very happy to be a part of,” Blanco-Quiroga said. “To get to meet other
        people from different Indigenous communities made me feel more welcome on campus.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Lynn reflected on Blanco-Quiroga’s advocacy initiatives beyond being a Projects for Peace winner.
      </p>
      <p>
        “From the moment I met him, there was just this expression of ‘I’m dedicated to working within my community and
        that’s why I’m here at Princeton.’ I am just blown away every time I speak to him,” he said. “His humility and
        his ability to connect with many people around an issue he is dedicated to is so incredible.”

        Blanco-Quiroga reiterated that he sees the Chacha Emprende Project as a starting point for more work to be done
        in his community and within the University.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “There is still so much work to do, and I feel I can contribute to that,” he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Princeton is investing in Indigenous studies and Indigenous students,” Lynn said. “I am excited to see that
        commitment deepen and grow. There are so many possibilities to engage with Indigenous rights and Indigenous
        students, faculty, and staff that would be attuned to the rights and needs of Indigenous people and communities
        right here in New Jersey, such as the Ramapough and Lenape.”&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Lynn went on to discuss his time living in Bolivia, comparing community organizing there with Indigenous
        advocacy in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I think that it’s important to note that there are 36 languages spoken in Bolivia. They are all recognized
        officially in the constitution,” Lynn said. “Not that everything is perfect in Bolivia, of course, but I think
        the West and the United States have a lot to learn from Bolivia in terms of how Indigenous frameworks can be
        part of our national story moving forward.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In Lynn’s view, Blanco-Quiroga’s project has helped further that goal by contributing to a culture of service at
        Princeton that is based on understanding and true community needs.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “Gustavo worked towards relationship building and community engagement in a way that expressed his commitment to
        his own community and his own reality,” he said. “That’s what we hope to see more of at the Pace Center:
        students speaking and working from their own positionalities. I think we can all engage that way.”

      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        <strong>NC:</strong> It’s always present to me that I am Indigenous. A lot of society and a lot of my
        interactions are framed in opposition to something that is not necessarily by my choice. Being Indigenous and
        going through society, you are constantly thought of as less or incapable. I think it is a blessing to be
        Indigenous and to be in spaces that were not meant for me and to navigate them in a way that we’ve always been
        capable of doing.

        Indigenous in classes and research in politics broadly. And we’ll never get the foothold that we need to support
        other Natives if we’re quiet when we should be supported.

      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        <strong>LB:</strong> It refers to Mauna Kea and the plans for a thirty-meter telescope to be built on it. Mauna
        Kea (Mauna a Wakea) is linked to the name of Wakea, the father of the Hawaiian islands. Thus, it is very sacred
        and important to Hawaiian culture. Many Native Hawaiians believe that a telescope on top of Mauna Kea would
        desecrate the sacred land, especially when there have been multiple instances of mismanagement from other
        research projects on Mauna Kea, dating back to 1998. I feel like people may expect me to be in support of the
        thirty-meter telescope being built, as I am majoring in civil engineering here. However, I believe that
        respecting the land and the Earth, as well as the people who live on it, is far more important than the

        <strong>The Daily Princetonian:</strong> Can you describe your Indigenous identity?
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        <strong>Rodrigo Córdova Rosado:</strong> Through my grandmother, I’m a citizen of the Osage Nation, Oklahoma.

      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        <strong>RCR:</strong> For the Osage, like most of the Plains tribes, it’s just about … they’re just shoes.
        They’re just shoes, but I have really come to appreciate them. To an extent it does connect you to an artistry
        and an artisanship of one side of my heritage, and getting to appreciate that through the walk of every day
        really comes to be pretty nice.

        <strong>DP:</strong> What’s one thing you want Princeton to learn, as a community, about what it means to be
        Native?
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        <strong>RCR:</strong> To be Indigenous is a pretty serious claim about what the nature of our relationship as
        people is, not only to the land, but to the past and in America as a whole. The past is present in a lot of
        ways. There are these consequences that I think we live through today by the nature of how reservations have
        much lower access to health care funding compared to Medicare, compared to other social welfare programs; the
        way that communities still don’t have the same access to education to see themselves in a fast changing world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP:</strong> Do you think it is students’ responsibility to learn about Indigenous culture and the land
        they’re inhabiting?
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        <strong>RCR:</strong> It’s certainly not their fault in any way, shape, or form, that they don’t know about
        these things. But it is, I think, a sadness that so few of us know about the history of the continent known as
        the Americas before the Europeans got here. I think it’s unfortunate that we have not cultivated a curiosity for
        learning the history of the land that we consider our right when the history is a little bit more complicated
        than that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP</strong>: You’re part of Natives of Princeton ... What is the role of that community in your life
        here?
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        <strong>RCR:</strong> So far, my relationship with Princeton has been one of connecting with a community that I
        didn’t have access to when I was in the UK, and a community that I didn’t really have access to when I was in
        Puerto Rico. I guess it’s been quite nice to see students who are thinking through these ideas of, “what does
        indigeneity mean in a world that is predominantly not learning about Indigenous people?” Being this voice of,
        “What does it mean to be this body within a system that doesn’t necessarily care about me or doesn’t necessarily
        know about this part of me?” has been an interesting twist of my life. Going from interrogating these questions
        personally and without many answers, to now trying to facilitate those questions for others.

          <h1 class="headline"> Jessica Lambert ’22 reflects on indigenous studies, advocacy at Princeton</h1>
          <p>By Isabel Yip</p>
        </div>

      </div>

      <p>
        For her <a
          href="https://dataspace.princeton.edu/bitstream/88435/dsp01h989r638v/1/LAMBERT-JESSICA-THESIS.pdf">senior
          thesis</a>, Jessica Lambert ’22 decided to write about the land and people where her “heart really lies.”
      </p>
      <p>
        As a citizen of the Choctaw Nation, Lambert wanted to write about environmental contamination on native lands.
        Without a clear path for pursuing this passion at the University, she sought out faculty members and mentors in
        Indigenous studies at Princeton particularly focusing on environmental justice. In the end, the anthropology
        major would go on to work with two advisors — one in her department and another in geosciences — and win the
        2022 Center for Digital Humanities Senior Thesis Prize, using her humanities and science backgrounds to speak
        with residents and conduct environmental sampling on Choctaw reservation lands.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It was this really cross-disciplinary project that at its core was looking at how Choctaw human and
        environmental health was being impacted by this pollution,” Lambert said in an interview with The Daily
        Princetonian. “I was figuring out how to integrate natural science and its quantitative data with social science
        and the qualitative understanding of what impact this facility was having on the environment.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The town of McAlester, which Lambert focused on in her thesis, has been the site of a U.S. military facility
        where old bombs are detonated and decommissioned. As a result, harmful chemicals and pollutants are released
        into Choctaw air, water, and land — a key way in which settler colonialism and ongoing Native land theft
        continue to materially impact the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduation, Lambert interned at the White House Council on Environmental Quality, focusing on
        environmental justice in the Office of the Federal Chief Sustainability Officer. Currently, she is at The
        Wilderness Society doing Government Relations, where she works on protecting and providing access to public
        lands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lambert’s interest in Indigenous studies connects back to the beginning of her time as an anthropology
        concentrator, with her junior paper. Her paper focused on young Native women in anthropology, like herself, as
        well as early Indigenous anthropologists and the effects that American anthropology has had on Indigenous
        populations.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “I wrote about this to really ground myself and better understand what discipline I’m coming from,” she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of the classroom, Lambert led advocacy for Native students at Princeton. In co-leading the Princeton
        Indigenous Advocacy Coalition, Lambert pushed for Indigenous studies to be expanded on campus, including through
        a partnership with the Native American Alumni Association that secured a <a
          href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/12/princeton-establishes-professorship-of-indigenous-studies">$5
          million grant</a> for an endowed chair of Indigenous studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We did a ton of advocacy related to the gaps that Princeton had in terms of Indigenous studies, in terms of
        institutional support for Native students, making sure that Princeton’s recruitment strategies for admission are
        efficiently and actively targeting Native students to make sure that Native students know that Princeton is a
        great place to come,” she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Princeton Indigenous Advocacy Coalition was well received by the University administration, Lambert said.
      </p>
      <p>
        She also helped develop the <a
          href="https://indigenous.princeton.edu/#:~:text=Princeton's%20Native%20American%20and%20Indigenous,interests%20focus%20on%20Indigenous%20peoples.">Native
          American and Indigenous studies Initiative at Princeton</a> (NAISIP) webpage, which presents information about
        events, associated faculty, and courses connected to Indigenous studies for interested students. Associated
        staff of the program belong to a wide array of departments.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “I helped develop the Indigenous studies website,” Lambert said. “One of the really core things that I
        identified as a barrier to recognizing how much Indigenous sites infrastructure we already had going on at
        Princeton was just that it wasn’t in one place.”
      </p>

        During the beginning of her time at Princeton, Indigenous studies were an independent venture. “Back then you
        really had to seek out a professor who was doing it, and it was very much on your own,” she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Indigenous studies is not currently a concentration or certificate at the University, Lambert said she
        hopes that it will become a formal program at the University in coming years and that the groundwork for that
        has been laid down during her time on campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        A formalized program of study, in Lambert’s view, would encourage more students to explore Indigenous studies,
        even through exposure to one introductory course.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “I think that helps, not only people who come in wanting to do Indigenous studies, but having a program there
        makes it so much more visible for every student,” she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically for Native students, the creation of a program involves “structures or supporting Native students
        who are doing Indigenous studies,” Lambert said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout her time at Princeton, she also focused on community building in student groups. When she started in
        2018, Natives at Princeton, a student organization providing Native students with support and community, “didn’t
        have a lot of visibility and it was hard for people to find,” she said. When she was one of the co-presidents of
        Natives at Princeton, the group obtained an affinity space in Green Hall for students to meet, work, and talk
        with one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Having a space where we can be ourselves has been just so life-changing in terms of how tight-knit and close
        the Native community is on campus,” Lambert said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking toward the future, Lambert’s biggest hope is that the progress she helped spark will only lead to more
        advocacy and promises kept by the University.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hopefully, soon we will have a certificate or a concentration in Indigenous studies to help more formally
        solidify and grow all the progress that’s happened over the last few years,” she said. “I think there’s a lot
        more to come that I’m excited for.”

        <em>Content Warning: The following column references settler colonialism and violence against Alaska Natives and
          their cultures.&nbsp;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sitka, Alaska, a tiny, waterfront town situated on the west coast of the Alexander Archipelago, is over 2,800
        miles away from Princeton, N.J. Yet despite the distance between them, Sitka and Princeton are inextricably
        linked through the actions of one man: Sheldon Jackson.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Although often <a href="http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/articles/s_haycox/sheldon_jackson.htm"
          target="_self">memorialized</a> (in the process of writing this column, I found that most of the sources I
        consulted celebrated Jackson’s legacy) as the person who brought Western education and Protestantism to Alaska,
        Jackson was in fact a key agent in the denial, destruction, and appropriation of Alaska Native cultures.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/articles/s_haycox/sheldon_jackson.htm" target="_self">1877</a>,
        Princeton Theological Seminary graduate and Presbyterian missionary <a
          href="http://www.alaskaweb.org/bios/jacksonsheldon.html">Sheldon Jackson</a> arrived in Sitka on his first
        mission to Alaska. By 1878, he had founded the <a
          href="https://noehill.com/ak_sitka/nat1972000193.asp#:~:text=The%20core%20of%20the%20district,with%20a%20degree%20in%20theology.">Sitka
          Mission</a>, which sought to “assimilate” Alaska Native boys in the vicinity, who were primarily <a
          href="https://alaskapublic.org/2021/08/05/its-not-a-typo-why-we-are-using-lingit-instead-of-tlingit/">Lingít</a>
        and <a href="https://www.haidanation.ca/haida-nation/">Haida</a>. The school, which changed names many times and
        eventually became the <a href="https://www.sjvoices.org/sheldon-jackson-college.html">Sheldon Jackson
          College</a>, was the first American <a href="https://archives.alaska.gov/education/boarding.html">boarding
          school</a> for Alaska Natives where children were separated from their parents, punished for speaking their
        native languages, and denied access to their cultures. &nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        In large part due to his efforts, Jackson was appointed the <a
          href="http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/articles/s_haycox/sheldon_jackson.htm">first</a> General Agent of
        Education in Alaska, a position he held from 1885 to 1907. As General Agent of Education in Alaska, Jackson
        helped <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/timeline/366.html">implement</a> a plan to <a
          href="http://www.ankn.uaf.edu/curriculum/Articles/History/TomHopkins/ANE/BriefHistory.html">divide</a> Alaska
        among various Christian religious denominations, so that missionaries representing different Christian faiths
        would have an assigned area in which to proselytize in the territory. Jackson’s efforts were pivotal in the
        establishment of American <a href="https://archives.alaska.gov/education/boarding.html">boarding schools</a> for
        Native children across Alaska.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Jackson was not a Princetonian himself, his legacy is deeply tied to the University. During his time in
        Alaska, Jackson collected nearly <a href="https://museums.alaska.gov/sheldon_jackson/sjgalleries.html">5,000</a>
        items belonging to Alaska Natives across the peninsula. While the majority of these items are housed at the <a
          href="https://museums.alaska.gov/sheldon_jackson/sjhome.html">Sheldon Jackson Museum</a> in Sitka, Jackson
        also <a href="https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/story/new-research-art-northwest-coast">sent</a> Alaska Native
        goods (in addition to Native goods from Washington and Arizona) to the <a
          href="https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/story/art-ancient-americas">Princeton Theological Seminary</a>. These
        goods eventually were transferred to the Trustees of what was then Princeton College. Today, they are ‘owned’ by
        the University’s Department of Geosciences and are currently on <a
          href="https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/story/new-research-art-northwest-coast">loan</a> to the Princeton
        University Art Museum. The majority of the material acquired by the University through Sheldon Jackson <a
          href="https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/story/new-research-art-northwest-coast" target="_self">remains</a>
        unknown or unidentified in its origin. &nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        I, like many Princetonians, was unaware of the connection between Sitka and Princeton until this May, when I had
        the opportunity to visit Alaska through a trip sponsored by Princeton’s <a
          href="https://reees.princeton.edu/">Program in Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies</a>.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Before arriving in Alaska, I was prepared to <a
          href="https://reees.princeton.edu/news/2022/alaska-reflection-genrietta-churbanova">confront</a> Russia’s
        colonial legacy there. After all, one of the key objectives of the trip was to help students reach a deeper
        understanding about the history and lingering influence of the Russian Empire’s <a
          href="https://www.nps.gov/sitk/learn/historyculture/the-russians.htm">colonization</a> of Alaska, whose
        100-odd year stint as a Russian territory often goes overlooked. I did not, however, expect to find that
        Princeton <a href="http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/articles/s_haycox/sheldon_jackson.htm"></a>— the
        municipality and University alike <a
          href="http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/articles/s_haycox/sheldon_jackson.htm"></a>— remains connected to
        American colonization of the Alaskan peninsula.
      </p>
      <p>
        As members of the Princeton community, it is time we collectively acknowledge that Sheldon Jackson’s legacy is
        tied to our university and that the Department of Geosciences holds objects he ‘collected.’ To do so would mark
        a key step in scrutinizing the University’s connection to the systemic racism and settler colonialism that
        characterizes the past and the present of the United States. As for the items held by the Department of
        Geosciences, whether they should be returned to the descendants of those who made them or kept in scholastic
        institutions is not for me to say: only the people to whom they rightfully belong can speak on what their future
        should hold.
